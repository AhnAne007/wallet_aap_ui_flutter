# wallet_app_ui

Flutter project for making the UI of the wallet app.

## User Story 
As a user, I want to download and install the wallet app on my smartphone to begin managing my finances efficiently.

Scenario 1: Creating an Account

As a new user, I open the wallet app on my smartphone.
I am presented with an option to create a new account.
I enter my personal details, such as name, email address, and a secure password.
After successfully providing the required information, I tap on the "Create Account" button.
The app verifies my information and creates my wallet account.

Scenario 2: Adding Funds

As a user with an account, I open the wallet app on my smartphone.
I am greeted with a dashboard displaying my current balance and recent transactions.
To add funds to my wallet, I navigate to the "Add Funds" section.
I choose my preferred payment method, such as credit/debit card or bank transfer.
I enter the required payment details and the amount I wish to add to my wallet.
Once I confirm the transaction, the app securely processes the payment and updates my wallet balance accordingly.

Scenario 3: Making a Transaction

As a user with sufficient funds in my wallet, I open the wallet app on my smartphone.
From the dashboard, I select the "Make a Transaction" option.
I enter the recipient's details, including their name, mobile number, or email address.
Next, I input the transaction amount and optionally add a description.
I review the transaction details and verify that everything is correct.
Once I'm confident, I authorize the transaction by providing my unique PIN or using biometric authentication.
The app processes the transaction securely and updates my wallet balance accordingly.
I receive a notification confirming the successful completion of the transaction.

Scenario 4: Tracking Expenses

As a user interested in monitoring my expenses, I open the wallet app on my smartphone.
The app's dashboard displays my current balance prominently.
I navigate to the "Expenses" section, which provides a breakdown of my recent transactions.
I can filter the transactions by date, category, or merchant name.
The app categorizes each transaction and displays it accordingly, making it easy to identify spending patterns.
Additionally, I have the option to add custom tags or notes to transactions for better organization.
The app automatically updates my wallet balance by subtracting the amount spent in each transaction.
I can view my transaction history, helping me analyze my spending habits and make informed financial decisions.
